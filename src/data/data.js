export const aboutDescription = `I am passionate about building excellent software that improves the lives of those around me.
                                I'm pretty good at problem solving skills and have worked on different projects to learn new 
                                things. Lately, I'm really into Large Language Models and AI/ML because they're growing so fast.
                                I enjoy using my skills to create software that not only works well but also makes a positive 
                                impact on people's lives.`;
